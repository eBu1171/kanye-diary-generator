# Kanye-Style Diary Entry Generator

This project fine-tunes an OpenAI GPT model to generate reflective diary entries in Kanye West's distinctive style - philosophical, direct, and self-aware.

## How to Use This Generator

Follow these steps to create your own Kanye-style diary entry generator:

### Step 1: Set Up the Model

1. First, run the fine-tuning script:
   ```bash
   python create_kanye_model.py
   ```
   This uploads the training data and starts a fine-tuning job. Note the `job_id` in the output.

2. Update the `job_id` in the check script:
   ```
   # In check_kanye_model.py
   job_id = "YOUR_JOB_ID_HERE"  # Replace with the ID from Step 1
   ```

3. Check the status of the fine-tuning job:
   ```bash
   python check_kanye_model.py
   ```
   Fine-tuning typically takes 15-30 minutes. When complete, note the `fine_tuned_model` ID.

4. Update the model ID in the generator script:
   ```
   # In batch_generate_kanye.py
   fine_tuned_model = "YOUR_MODEL_ID_HERE"  # Replace with the ID from Step 3
   ```

### Step 2: Generate Diary Entries

Run the batch generator to create Kanye-style diary entries:
```bash
python batch_generate_kanye.py
```

This will:
- Generate 10 Kanye-style diary entries (configurable)
- Use varied prompts for different topics
- Save all entries to a timestamped JSON file

## Format and Style

The generated entries follow Kanye West's distinctive style:
- Short, direct statements
- Philosophical and often self-referential
- Raw, emotional, and self-aware
- No hashtags or emojis
- Punchy and thought-provoking

## Customization

You can modify the generator in several ways:
- Edit `kanye.jsonl` to include different examples
- Change the prompts in `batch_generate_kanye.py` to focus on other topics
- Adjust the number of entries generated by changing `num_entries`

## Sample Output

Here's an example of what the generated entries look like:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Write a Kanye-style diary entry about vision.",
  "entry": "They mock what they can't understand. My vision is so far ahead, people think it's fiction. But today's fiction is tomorrow's reality. I don't see walls, only doors waiting to be kicked open.",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-17T11:45:23.123456"
}
```

Enjoy creating your Kanye-inspired philosophical musings!
